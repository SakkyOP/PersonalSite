            <h3>Programmer</h3>
            <p>One of the things that I am most fond of is Programming. I have a Intermediate knowledge in <strong>Python</strong>, It was my first language and I have worked on various projects in <strong>Python</strong>. Currently I am learning <strong>Web Development</strong>, I have a little knowledge on <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, and I am excited to learn <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I am also a beginner at <strong>C/C++</strong>, as in I have the basic knowledge about the syntax and semantics.</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>One of the things that fascinates me are Games. I am very enthusiastic about the new and upcoming games and would call myself somewhat of a gamer. In competitive gaming, I must admit I am not that great, I can hold my ground well but I would definitly say that there are better players than me out there. I have an experience in <strong>Valorant</strong>, <strong>CSGO</strong>.</p>
